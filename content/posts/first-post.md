# About me and this whole blog thing
Heyy, so welcome to my blog! I don't know how often I'm gonna work on this but at least I'll try to do something. I thought it would be good for me to start a blog because then I could practice my writing and creative side with this.

Cause I've never really been a creative person but I actually have gained more confidence in myself, in that I could write stuff. I haven't really had a reason to write anything major, so this could be my playground where I practice!

I plan to do energy drink reviews cause it's my hobby essentially currently and it's what keeps me motivated these days, random shit whenever I feel like it and just general blog entries about my daily life and stuff like that.

# Energy Drinks
I'm really passionate about energy drinks and I don't really know why, cause I don't drink them for energy (caffeine), but instead I drink them for the flavour and the experience and the quote-on-quote "vibe". I started drinking energy drinks I think 1 year ago at this point, I remember the exact date as well, Feb 13, 2023.

My first ever energy drink that I tried was Monster Mango Loco, I remember being kinda confused at the time cause it tasted like a soda but it has extra caffeine which is what I still think to this day, that energy drinks are just sodas with extra caffeine cause sodas already have about 50mg of caffeine in them and energy drinks don't have that much more (usually around 160mg). For reference coffee has around 100mg and an espresso has around 50mg of caffeine.

# Programming
I've never really been "good" at programming in the general sense. I know how to build a few basic things but that's basically it.

Up until now I've always started so many projects saying to everyone "I'm gonna make this awesome ass thing and you're all gonna love it!!!!!" but never really going past the initial phase of the project (stuff like installing basic dependencies and creating a basic website), SOMETIMES I'd actually work on minor things like for the Discord bot projects I'd make a few basic commands for kicking and banning but I never actually had the consistency to keep working on the project, nor usually the technical skill and understanding of the language.

I knew generally how programming languages functioned and operated but writing new code was really difficult for me so I never learned much of anything.

# Languages
I feel like the same thing with my programming capabilities applies to my linguistic abilities as well. I say to myself constantly that I wanna learn X language and I'm gonna actually do it this time, unlike the 700 billion other times I've said that.

The reason I think I feel this way is because I learned French by myself, but my mind is frustrated as to why I could learn French but not other languages even though I applied the same tactics as I did when learning French. It was pretty recent as well in the grand scheme of things (right before the pandemic I think?). To be honest I don't really know how I learned French myself, all I remember is that I wrote down a bunch of words and used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and magically remembered a large chunk of what I had written.

Estonian and English don't count because I learned those basically when I was a baby, Estonian being my mother tongue and English I learned basically when I was starting to learn how to read.

# In Conclusion
But thats basically all I have for this entry to say about myself and my hobbies, so thank you for reading this and see you whenever I make a new post!
