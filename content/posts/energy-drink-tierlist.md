# The List
1. Monster Pacific Punch - This is my favourite energy drink of all time, the cherry and cinnamon flavour is just god tier 10/10

4. Red Bull White - It's such an accurate coconut flavour with undertones of berry 9.7/10

51. Black Cat Original - Another "Original" tasting drink 4.3/10
52. Dynamit Magic Tingle - I think it's trying to be blackcurrant but it fails so miserably and instead tastes like rubber, I've also always had the sentiment that there aren't bad energy drink flavours but this changes my mind 3.0/10
