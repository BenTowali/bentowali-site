Maybe in the future I'll write a post for each energy drink, for now I'm too lazy to do that

# The List
1. Monster Pacific Punch - This is my favourite energy drink of all time, the cherry and cinnamon flavour is just god tier 10/10

5. Red Bull White - It's such an accurate coconut flavour with undertones of berry 9.7/10
