Maybe in the future I'll write a post for each energy drink, for now I'm too lazy to do that

# The List
1. Monster Pacific Punch - This is my favourite energy drink of all time, the cherry and cinnamon flavour is just god tier 10/10
2. Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach - OH MY GOD THIS FLAVOUR IS SO GOOD, it's like a peach with orange undertones and creamy 10/10
3. Monster Aussie Lemonade - It's just carbonated lemonade 10/10
4. Monster Khaotic - It's a very gummy orange flavour 8.8/10
5. Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams - It's like strawberries and cream with a strawberry aftertaste, I do wish the flavour was a bit stronger but that's just nitpicking 8.4/10
6. Monster Ultra Zero - Whenever I want an energy drink and don't really care which one I choose this, it's a very strong citrus flavour but so refreshing 7.8/10
7. Monster Reserve White Pineapple - Pineapple flavour 7.2/10
8. Monster Mule - For a monster "based on" ginger it hardly has a ginger flavour, but does have the ginger feel 7.2/10
9. Nocco Limon del Sol - It's a knock off of Monster Aussie Lemonade and sprite 7.1/10
10. Nocco Golden Era - It's like an acidic yellow apple flavour 6.3/10
11. Nocco Blood Orange - It's a orange sesame seed flavour 6.0/10
12. Red Bull Mixed Fruit - It's like a weird pear 4.9/10
13. Nocco Grand Sour - It's like a meh sour flavour 4.8/10
14. Red Bull Passionfruit - What. 4.7/10
15. Nocco Juicy Melba - It tastes like a vanilla flavoured car battery 4.7/10
16. Nocco Ramonade - It's like a really sour apple soda 4.4/10
17. Nocco Sunny Soda - It doesn't taste like cola at all 4.4/10
